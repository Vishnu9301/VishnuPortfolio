        <h2 class="underline">Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This project, conducted between 2022 and 2023, focused on optimizing the management and distribution of Amazon Music Subscription Promotion spare claim codes. The primary objectives were to reduce financial losses from unused codes, enhance operational efficiency, and improve customer experience. By replacing the outdated regional codes with a new global system, the project achieved significant cost savings and improved code utilization by the end of 2023.</p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2 class="underline">Project Overview</h2>
        <h4>Situation:</h4>
        <p>In early 2022, it was identified that the existing system for managing Amazon Music Subscription Promotion codes, which was divided between the EU and NA regions, was leading to significant financial losses due to underutilization. The old codes were unlimited in count, complicating management and tracking.</p>

        <h4>Task:</h4>
        <p>The project involved revoking access to the old codes, acquiring a new set of global claim codes, and implementing a streamlined system to enhance the utilization and effectiveness of these codes. The success of this initiative was measured through a comprehensive review at the end of 2023.</p>

            <li>Ensure codes are distributed only to eligible customers through a newly developed SOP.</li>
            <li>Enhance customer experience and satisfaction by reducing error rates in code distribution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Scope:</h4>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2 class="underline">Project Plan</h2>
        <h4>Revocation of Old Codes:</h4>
        <p>Analyzed the financial impact of the old codes in early 2022, identifying a $158,024.74 loss due to underutilization. Successfully revoked access to the outdated codes by mid-2022 and communicated the changes to the CS team.</p>

        <h4>Acquisition of New Codes:</h4>
        <p>Collaborated with the Amazon Music Global Promotion Team to acquire a new, limited set of global codes aligned with current business needs by Q3 2022.</p>

        <h4>Development and Implementation of SOP:</h4>
        <p>Developed a new SOP by Q4 2022, including stringent customer validation and fraud checks before issuing codes. Implemented the SOP and trained the CS team by Q1 2023.</p>
