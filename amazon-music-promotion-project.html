        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This project, conducted between 2022 and 2023, focused on optimizing the management and distribution of Amazon Music Subscription Promotion spare claim codes. The primary objectives were to reduce financial losses from unused codes, enhance operational efficiency, and improve customer experience. By replacing the outdated regional codes with a new global system, the project achieved significant cost savings and improved code utilization by the end of 2023.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>

        <h3>Situation</h3>
        <p>
            In early 2022, it was identified that the existing system for managing Amazon Music Subscription Promotion codes, which was divided between the EU and NA regions, was leading to significant financial losses due to underutilization. The old codes were unlimited in count, complicating management and tracking.
        </p>

        <h3>Task</h3>
        <p>
            The project involved revoking access to the old codes, acquiring a new set of global claim codes, and implementing a streamlined system to enhance the utilization and effectiveness of these codes. The success of this initiative was measured through a comprehensive review at the end of 2023.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Charter</h2>

            <li>Improve the utilization rate of promotion codes by 50% year-over-year.</li>
            <li>Ensure codes are distributed only to eligible customers through a newly developed SOP.</li>
            <li>Enhance customer experience and satisfaction by reducing error rates in code distribution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Scope</h3>

        </ul>

        <h3>Stakeholder Management</h3>
        <p>
            Regular bi-weekly meetings were held with the Amazon Music Global Promotion Team to ensure project alignment. Workshops with the CS Team ensured compliance and understanding of the new SOP by the end of Q1 2023. A continuous feedback loop was established with the Quality Assurance Team to monitor code utilization and compliance throughout 2023.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Plan</h2>

        <h3>Revocation of Old Codes</h3>
        <p>
            Analyzed the financial impact of the old codes in early 2022, identifying a $158,024.74 loss due to underutilization. Successfully revoked access to the outdated codes by mid-2022 and communicated the changes to the CS team.
        </p>

        <h3>Acquisition of New Codes</h3>
        <p>
            Collaborated with the Amazon Music Global Promotion Team to acquire a new, limited set of global codes aligned with current business needs by Q3 2022.
        </p>

        <h3>Development and Implementation of SOP</h3>
        <p>
            Developed a new SOP by Q4 2022, including stringent customer validation and fraud checks before issuing codes. Implemented the SOP and trained the CS team by Q1 2023.
        </p>

        <h2>Test Launch Findings</h2>

        <h3>Initial Observations</h3>
        <p>
            During the test launch in early 2023, challenges in code validation were identified, leading to slight delays in customer interactions. Feedback from the CS team highlighted areas for SOP improvement, particularly in handling edge cases.
        </p>

        <h3>Adjustments Made</h3>
        <p>
            Enhanced the validation process in Q2 2023 to address the identified challenges. Updated the SOP based on feedback and conducted additional training sessions to address gaps.
        </p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            Improved customer response times and code utilization during the test phase. Positive feedback from customers regarding the streamlined process.
        </p>

        <h2>Retrospective and Impact Report</h2>

        <h3>Cost Savings</h3>
        <p>
            By the end of 2023, the project resulted in significant cost savings, reducing the value of unused codes from $158,024.74 in 2022 to $34,927.57, leading to net savings of $123,097.17.
        </p>

        <h3>Improved Utilization</h3>
        <p>
            Utilization of the new global codes increased by 50%, with 6.62% of the codes used within the first quarter of 2023, compared to lower utilization rates of the old system.
        </p>

        <h3>Enhanced Efficiency</h3>
        <p>
            The new SOP ensured that only eligible customers received codes, reducing the risk of fraud and increasing overall efficiency by 30% compared to the previous system.
        </p>

        <h3>Customer Experience</h3>
        <p>
            Customer feedback at the end of 2023 indicated a better experience due to faster response times and more reliable code distribution.
