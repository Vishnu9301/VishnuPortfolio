        <h2 class="underline">Summary</h2>
        <p>In the Sauce & Spoon capstone project, I successfully managed the pilot rollout of tabletop menu tablets across two restaurant locations—Sauce & Spoon North and Sauce & Spoon Downtown. The objective was to enhance the dining experience by reducing service delays and improving order accuracy, leading to increased customer satisfaction and profitability. Through this project, I guided the team from the planning phase to successful execution, addressing key challenges such as stakeholder misalignment, staff training, and process optimization, ultimately achieving a smoother and more efficient service experience for customers.</p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        
        <h2 class="underline">Solution</h2>
        <p>To address the increasing service delays and negative customer feedback, I implemented a strategic rollout of tabletop menu tablets. The solution involved a comprehensive plan that included selecting the right tablet packages, training staff, and integrating the new system with existing POS software. This initiative aimed to decrease table turn time, reduce food waste, and boost customer satisfaction. By leveraging data-driven decision-making, I ensured that the tablets were effectively used to increase sales, improve order accuracy, and reduce employee burnout, leading to measurable improvements in the restaurant’s operational efficiency and profitability.</p>
        
        <h3>Key achievements include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A 15% increase in product mix through tablet-integrated menu add-ons and coupons.</li>
          <li>A 30-minute reduction in average table turn time, improving overall customer wait times.</li>
          <li>A 25% decrease in food waste and a 15% reduction in meal comps by streamlining communication between the waitstaff and kitchen.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="section-divider"></div>        

        <h2 class="underline">Approach</h2>
        <p>My approach to the Sauce & Spoon project was meticulous, involving several critical steps to ensure successful delivery:</p>

        <h3 class="bold">Project Planning & Goal Setting:</h3>
        <p>I began by establishing clear, measurable goals, such as reducing table turn time and increasing product mix. I ensured alignment among stakeholders by creating a detailed project charter that outlined the scope, goals, and deliverables.</p>

        <h3 class="bold">Stakeholder Management & Communication:</h3>
        <p>I navigated several stakeholder misalignments, particularly concerning resource allocation and sales targets, by facilitating discussions and reaching compromises that aligned with the overall project objectives.</p>

        <h3 class="bold">Execution & Training:</h3>
        <p>I oversaw the selection and installation of the tablets and coordinated comprehensive training for the staff. This training was essential for ensuring that the new technology was used effectively and that it integrated seamlessly with the existing systems.</p>

        <h3 class="bold">Monitoring & Adjustments:</h3>
        <p>During the pilot launch, I closely monitored the tablet usage, gathering feedback from customers through surveys. This allowed me to identify and address issues such as longer-than-expected wait times and order inaccuracies, ensuring continuous improvement throughout the project.</p>

        <h3 class="bold">Post-Launch Evaluation & Recommendations:</h3>
        <p>After the launch, I analyzed the project outcomes against the initial goals. The findings highlighted areas for further improvement, such as enhancing the checkout process and optimizing the tablet layout. I provided actionable recommendations, including additional staff training and adjustments to the tablet interface, to further refine the customer experience.</p>
